        <p>Design is a good thing and the makers of evolveOS have understood it.
          In order to leverage the distribution, the <a href="https://github.com/evolve-os/budgie-desktop">budgie desktop</a> has been brought to
          existence, and simply put - its the best thing about evolveOS - yet:
        </p>
        <p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evolve-os/budgie-desktop/master/Screenshot.png" alt=""></p>
        <h1>Budgie</h1>
        <p>The core part of evolveOS, the budgie desktop, is written mostly in C, but is on its transition to Vala.
          The minimalistic looks can be well combined with the <a href="http://me4oslav.deviantart.com/art/Numix-Circle-Linux-Desktop-Icon-Theme-414741466">Numix Circular Icons</a>.
        </p>
        <h1>Technical details</h1>
        <p>Sadly, the information about evolveOS provided on the homepage is very thin.
          The system does not seem to be one of the bleeding-edge, but one where packages and system updates
          are published with time. The package manager is forked from the PiSi package manager,
          taken from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pardus_(operating_system">Pardus</a>).
        </p>
        <p>evolveOS is a totally new distribution and that manifests itself in its sleek
          system resource footprint. Booting up from a standard USB 2.0 stick into a live environment on
          a Thinkpad T420 is reasonably fast with about 15s to a working desktop.
        </p>
        <p>From the boot messages it is possible to see that <a href="http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/">systemd</a> is being used,
          and that is a very good thing. It makes startup fast and streamlines the Linux distribution eco-system (finally).
        </p>
        <p>This distribution definitively has gotten the desktop right and that alone is a beautiful addition
          to the Linux ecosystem! Way to go!
